# Unity Events and Fun Stuff

This repository is only for experimenting and fun

## Scenes

There are different scenes for variuos experiments. For instance, *Dance* scene if for experimenting with prefabs behaviour.

```
SampleScene.scene
Dance.scene
TileGenerator.scene

```

## Scripts

There is a separate folder for all scripts called *Scripts*. Inside that folder there are subfolders for each scene, because there will a
lot of experiments based on separate scripts. Names of scripts more or less similar, at least in meaning, to scenes' names so it is easy to
find which script is responsible for a certain function.

## Textures

Separate folder for all types of textures. I am not going to test a lot of textures so far. Maybe in the future I will create subfolders
for *Normal map*, *Albedo map*, *Metallic*.

## Prefabs

Separate folder for prefabs, mostly of those that will be spawned a lot of times

## Materials

Separate folder for materials.
